**** BATTLESHIP V1.0 ****

- Meets minimum Odin spec with very basic design/interactivity.

To complete in future versions:
- Create a smart AI that selects boxes near ones already hit.
- Refactor code to make lighter.
-   Reorganise flow - not clear when setting up ends and playing starts.
-   Look at naming/id/classes - increase separation.
- Need ship templates? Add more ships than 5.
- UX/UI/Design
-   Improve aesthetic - very basic.
-   User interaction - name and profile.
-   Add labels to axis - looks neater.
-   Improve message board and interactivity, including typing effect, timeout.
- Testing
-   Not sure I've got the hang of this but feels like a reasnable intro!
