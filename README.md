# Battleship V1.5

## About

This is a version of the classic game Battleship, which I built for [The Odin Project, Full Stack Web Development Course, Javascript Module](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship). The purpose of this was to practice using Javascript and Test Driven Development (using Jest).

A user can play against the computer, with all instructions appearing on the screen.

* Add labels to axis (1-12, a-l);
* Add reset button;
* Add key functionality (select sqs, space bar to flip direction when placing);
* Make responsive with media queries;
* Revisit testing - see if any more tests to add.
